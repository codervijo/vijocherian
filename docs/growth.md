# Growth Log — vijocherian.com

> **What this file is for:** an honest, append-only log of growth experiments
> on this site — what was tried, what was measured, what happened. The data
> source is GSC; this file narrates *why*. Future-you (or future-Claude)
> reads this when deciding what to try next, both on this site and on
> related sister sites.

## How to use this (workflow — re-read this when you forget)

**Add an entry whenever you do something growth-relevant.** That includes:
shipping new content, structural SEO changes (sitemap, schema, redirects,
internal linking), tech changes that affect crawl/indexing, marketing
pushes, backlink campaigns. *Not* every code commit — just things you'd
want to point at when GSC numbers move (or fail to).

**Each entry is a hypothesis you can be wrong about.** Commit to a
measurable KPI and an observation window before acting — otherwise "did
this work?" is just a feeling.

### Lifecycle of one entry

1. **Day of action** — append a new dated H2 with `Status: active`, the
   hypothesis, the KPI you'll watch, current baseline numbers, what you
   did, and the date to review (default: today + 28 days, matching GSC's
   reporting window).
2. **Review day** — pull current GSC numbers, compute delta vs baseline.
   Fill in **Result** and **Learning**. Set **Status** to `shipped` (worked,
   keep going), `failed` (didn't pay off, abandon), or extend the review
   another window if results are ambiguous.
3. **Never rewrite older entries.** Wrong hypotheses are the most valuable
   data — they tell you what NOT to repeat on the next site. Append, don't
   edit.

### Where to get the numbers

```bash
cd ~/work/projects/sites/portfolio && make run ARGS="gsc sync"
```

Then read the row for `vijocherian.com`. Or pull from
https://search.google.com/search-console directly.

### Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line hypothesis or action>
- **Status:** active | testing | shipped | failed | abandoned
- **Hypothesis:** <what you're betting will work — only on initial / new-bet entries>
- **KPI:** <what GSC metric / query / page>
- **Baseline:** <numbers at start>
- **Action:** <what was done; 1-2 lines>
- **Result:** <numbers after window; "TBD — review YYYY-MM-DD" until then>
- **Learning:** <why it worked / didn't; what to try next; "TBD" until reviewed>
```

## 2026-05-29 — The site grows by accretion, not campaign.
- **Status:** active
- **Hypothesis:** The site grows by accretion, not campaign. Each technical post is a small, durable SEO asset pulling in a narrow but high-intent audience over years — worth more per visitor than viral posts because it's people searching for exactly what Vijo does. Founder posts cross-promote into Swiftly tools and the newsletter, where the trend pipeline does its own commercial work. The CV converts whenever Vijo wants it to, with zero ongoing effort. The compounding asset isn't traffic volume but search presence on his name plus a handful of technical phrases where being on page one is genuinely useful — both for selling the products and for being found by the right employer.
- **KPI:** any GSC traffic — clicks, impressions, indexed-page count
- **Baseline:** 0 clicks / 0 impressions (just deployed)
- **Action:** project scaffolded via `portfolio new bootstrap`; first deploy pending. After deploy: verify in GSC as `sc-domain:vijocherian.com` and submit the sitemap.
- **Result:** TBD — review 2026-06-26
- **Learning:** TBD
